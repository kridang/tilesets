### Tileset 4

**Geographic Area Examined**
Queen Anne and South Lake union area.

**Available Zoom Levels**
Zoom levels 11–15.

**Description**
This tileset focuses on a local neighborhood area and allows for higher zoom levels. Despite their close proximity, South Lake Union and Queen Anne have different demographics and characteristics, with South Lake Union being more tech-oriented and fast-paced, while Queen Anne reflects a more residential and slower-paced environment. I wanted to learn more about this area for this reason. The theme of this tileset is Nature.
